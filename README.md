**Project Logo**<br>
![alt text](/img/gear.png "RussT logo")

<br>**Description**<br>
This program is built to be a mobile photo sharing application. The application will work by sending users pictures stored within a database. Twice a day users will be sent a batch of photos. The photos will be random and have no particular order. From there, users will be able to rate the photos on a 1-10 scale (1 horrible, 10 perfect) as well as leaving a comment. After they have submitted their rating, they will see the overall rating of the picture. Users will also have the ability to upload their own pictures for rating. There wil be tags associated with the pictures uploaded, along with push notifications when someone uploads a picture. 

<br>**Technologies**<br>
C++, Qt, JavaScript, QML, SQLite

<br>**Installation Instructions**<br>
To be determined. Will work more on installation properties as term progresses.

<br>**Contribution Guidelines**<br>
Contributions are primarily by Russ Hurtado and Travis Miller. Should someone else desire to make changes they must contact one of us before making changes final and/or committing them. Commits should have a clear, concise title with any further information in the description.

<br>**Bugs and TODO List**<br>
Current Bugs: None. 
<br>TODO List: Add the remaining screens to the project. Once screens are added, add the functionality and signals to those screens. Once every screen works visually, we will set up our SQL server to handle uploading pictures and core functionality of our program. As it stands, our project works visually, but not functionally. 

<br>**Revision History**<br>
Homescreen has been made is the main part of our program, it still needs some work. Login screen is our splash screen and works visually. Create account needs to have the camera be added.

<br>**Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives**<br>
The idea for this application came from many other social media sites, such as Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and iFunny. To separate our application from the ones mentioned above, we wanted it to be more personal, but also carefree. We want our application to let users be parts of certain friend groups that aren't in the current social media sites. This means that friends may have certain "circles" that they are a part of, such as a "Nature" theme, or "Sports Car" theme. By adding these friend groups, they will get notifications when someone from that group uploads or rates a picture in that tagged section, allowing the user to then look at that picture and add their own rating and comment.
